Theory and Findings

Does Jean's C4 Anemo res reduction still apply vertically if her burst misses mobs on Venti's Q

Significance

Jean's burst damage reach has a vertical limit but the effects of it can reach vertically further. Potential combination for Xiao midair strikes.

## Jean E Hold level Difference (Michael/mSoo#1561)

Tested this w/ Jean today lvl by lvl. Seems to be 20 lvl diff requirement (not the 25 stated in the library). I don't have/know how to record so I just took screenshots instead; I hope this is enough.

Evidence

Lvl 74 Jean vs lvl 95 Hillichurl = No lift

Lvl 75 Jean vs lvl 95 Hillichurl = Lift

Significance

Level units to 80 if you want to abuse fall damage on lvl 100 units on 12-3 PS. the video evidence in the library shows lvl 71 and 75 MC vs 95 units too; not 98 which may suggest the ~25 levels

## Is fall damage from Gale Blade based on distance travelled or velocity of the fall? (Wrax#7777)

Added 12/1/2020

Theory/Finding/Bug:

Jean's Elemental Skill: Gale Blade slam/fall damage is a % based on target max health. These percentage value ranges are based on velocity of the fall rather than height.

Evidence:

The first damage number is from simply pulling them to the ground after Jean's charged attack.

The second is for when they are flung high up in the air with Jean's skill.

You get relatively similar numbers despite the large difference in height from where the target falls.

Lvl 69 Hilichurl: 2.2k, 2.1k: https://youtu.be/fG90rk8K6-U

Lvl 70 Fatui Cicin Mage: 13.4k, 12.5k: https://youtu.be/EYO5-SCBH7Q

In this clip the second time Jean's skill is used the target flew and was thrown at a slight arc rather than straight up which resulted in reduced fall/slam damage.

Lvl 90 Fatui Cicin Mage (Thunderfury/soother domain):  39.4k, 22.9k https://youtu.be/v0ShwTzt9Fg

I believe that the large gap in damage (2.1k to 39.4k) is sufficient evidence to claim that the slam/fall damage is a percentage based on the target's max health. Damage isn't boosted by superconduct.

Evidence that its based on max hp: https://youtu.be/B1a3mCpDGkc

57k in the beginning when target had full hp, 53k at the end when target had only a sliver of health

Rough eyeballing based on the hp bar seems to be 20-25% damage: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/550599335524564993/781347956174487582/max_hp_eyeball.png 

Significance:

* Pulling target to the ground using Gale Blade rather than launching them results in similar damage applied faster.
* If choosing to launch target for cc reasons then make sure that its sent straight up so that it doesn't arc in order to maintain high damage.
* Also first damage based on target max hp in game?
